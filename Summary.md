#### **Method Selection Based on Test Results**

Based on the test results and performance analysis, we conclude that certain methods should be avoided due to their inefficiency or computational challenges:

### Methods to Avoid:
- **cropHash**: Highly computationally intensive, leading to excessively long processing times.
- **ORB**: Inefficient for frame comparison due to large numbers of frames and duplicate detection issues. Also, it’s time-consuming and not always accurate.
- **wHash**: Too slow and inefficient for many real-world applications.
- **colorHash**: While faster than the above methods, it still has limitations in handling frames with changes, making it less reliable for comparison tasks.
- **SSIM**: Slow and neglects frames that have undergone small changes.
- **Histogram Comparison**: Like SSIM, it's slow and tends to miss small changes in frames, making it less useful for real-time or high-volume image comparison tasks.

### Methods to Consider:
The following methods were found to perform well in terms of speed and accuracy, making them the most suitable for practical use cases:

- **aHash**: Fast, computationally efficient, and works well for comparing images with similar overall structures. It avoids duplicate frames and can process more frames in less time.
- **dHash**: Also fast and capable of detecting minor differences. It works well for identifying slight modifications in images while maintaining efficiency.
- **pHash**: Although a bit slower than aHash and dHash, pHash is highly robust to perceptual changes, making it ideal for scenarios where image similarity is based on content (not exact pixel matches), such as detecting duplicates or slightly altered images.
- **MSE**: The fastest method in terms of computational efficiency, without relying on external libraries (e.g., imagehash). It processes the most frames and performs well in pixel-level comparisons. However, it lacks the sophistication of perceptual methods like pHash.

#### **Final Decision: MSE vs. pHash**

Based on the research and test results, there is a close tie between **MSE** and **pHash**:

- **MSE**: It is the fastest option, processing the most frames with minimal computational cost. It is perfect when the focus is on pixel-level accuracy and when speed is the highest priority. However, it does not account for perceptual changes, so it may miss minor differences in visual content such as color or texture shifts and create frames even for smallest change visually.
  
- **pHash**: While slightly slower than MSE, pHash is more robust and handles perceptual changes better, particularly for images with minor alterations such as color shifts or background changes. This makes pHash a better choice when the accuracy of detecting small visual changes is more important than processing speed and would not create additional frames if changes are minimal.

#### **Recommendation**:
- **Use MSE** if speed is the priority and the images are expected to be similar with minimal perceptual differences.
- **Use pHash** if we need to account for minor changes in content (e.g., color or background modifications), where a slight trade-off in processing speed is acceptable.

By balancing these factors, we can choose the most suitable method based on your specific needs—whether that's speed or accuracy in handling minor visual transformations.
